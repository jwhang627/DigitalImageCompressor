Digital Image Compression Final Project

Undergraduate Students Version

Due May 12 11:00 AM

Objective: develop a DCT-based image compression system.

The system will have the following modules:

Encoder:
1. 8*8 DCT transform of the image;
2. Uniform quantization
3. Zig-zag scan (use table) and run-level coding;
4. Size + amplitude representation ofthe non-zero coefficients;
5. Use Huffman coder (to be provided by MATLAB) to encode run-size
sequence; Do binary representation of the amplitude;
6. Calculate the bit rate of the compressed image.

Decoder:
1. Inverse quantization;
2. Inverse run-level coding and zig-zag scan;
3. Inverse DCT;
4. Compute the PSNR of the reconstructed image;

Submission:
1. A 3 to 5 page report to summarize the implementation with PSNR-rate
curves for 3 test images;
2. Demo the encoder and decoder on the due day.
3. Email the source code in a zipped package before the demo
