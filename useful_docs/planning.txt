steps:
1. Check if height and width of the image is divided by 8. (import cv2)
   a. If it's not, then resize this image that can be divided by 8.
2. Grayscale this image. (from skimage.color import rgb2gray)
3. Scan this image 8x8 (by using your own DCT function).

grayimage[height,width]
for i in range(height/8):
    for j in range(width/8):
    	dct(grayimage[(0+8*i):(8+8*i),(0+8*j):(8+8*j)]

4. Print the result in "results" directory.
5. Do Uniform quantization.
6. Turn it into Huffman code.
   a. isolate spaces within bitmap.
